# üîÑ Fork Results & Agent Findings Display Feature

## Overview

The system now displays **fork results** and **agent findings** automatically when you run `npm start`. This provides real-time visibility into multi-agent processing and historical analysis results.

## What Gets Displayed

Every time the server starts, you'll see a dedicated section showing:

```
üìä FORK RESULTS & AGENT FINDINGS
======================================================================
[Fork Status Summary]

ü§ñ AGENT FINDINGS:
[Agent Results]
======================================================================
```

## Display Sections

### 1. Fork Status Summary

Shows recent database forks created in the last 24 hours, grouped by status:

**When no forks exist (first startup):**
```
üì≠ No recent fork activity (no forks created in last 24 hours)
```

**When forks exist:**
```
üîÑ Recent Forks (5 found):

  ‚úÖ COMPLETED (3):
    ‚Ä¢ skill        | Resume: abc123d9... Job: job456f2... | 2.45s    | 12:30:45 AM

### 2. Agent Findings Summary

Shows status for all 5 specialized agents:

**When no results exist:**
```

## How It Works

1. **During Startup:**
   - `displayForkResultsOnStartup()` is called after multi-agent system initializes
   - Function queries the database for recent fork activity
   - Displays summary of fork statuses and agent findings

2. **Data Sources:**
   - **Forks:** Queries `agent_forks` table
   - **Skill Results:** Queries `skill_agent_results` table
   - **Semantic Results:** Queries `semantic_agent_results` table
   - **Experience Results:** Queries `experience_agent_results` table
   - **Education Results:** Queries `education_agent_results` table
   - **Certification Results:** Queries `certification_agent_results` table

3. **Data Window:**
   - Shows forks from last 24 hours
   - Shows up to 5 recent results per agent
   - Calculates and displays average scores

## Code Location

**Main Implementation:**
- `server.js:2249-2381` - `displayForkResultsOnStartup()` function
- `server.js:2392` - Function call during startup

**Integration Points:**
- Database connection callback (line 109): Calls `initializeMultiAgentSystem()`
- Multi-agent initialization (line 132-166): Moved to separate function
- Server startup (line 2392): Calls `displayForkResultsOnStartup()`

## Triggering New Results

To generate fork and agent findings that will be displayed on the next startup:

1. **Upload a resume:**
```bash
curl -X POST -F "file=@resume.pdf" http://localhost:8084/api/upload-resume
# Returns: { resume_id: "abc123d9..." }
```

2. **Create a job description:**
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Senior Developer","description":"..."}' \
  http://localhost:8084/api/job-description
# Returns: { job_id: "job456f2..." }
```

3. **Run multi-agent scoring:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8084/api/score-multi-agent/abc123d9.../job456f2...
# Creates forks and stores results
```

4. **Restart server:**
```bash
npm start
# Now displays the fork results and agent findings!
```

## Features

‚úÖ **Automatic Display** - Shows on every startup
‚úÖ **Fork Status Grouping** - Organized by completion status
‚úÖ **Agent Results** - Shows recent scores and timing
‚úÖ **Average Calculations** - Computes mean score per agent
‚úÖ **Error Handling** - Gracefully handles missing tables
‚úÖ **Historical Data** - Shows last 24 hours of activity
‚úÖ **Helpful Hints** - Provides next steps when empty

## Agents Tracked

The system tracks results from 5 specialized agents:

| Agent | Purpose | Score Range |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **Skill** | Keyword and skill matching | 0-100% |
| **Semantic** | Semantic/embedding similarity | 0-100% |
| **Experience** | Experience level validation | 0-100% |
| **Education** | Education requirement matching | 0-100% |
| **Certification** | Certification matching | 0-100% |

## Database Tables

The display queries these tables (auto-created on first agent run):

- `agent_forks` - Fork metadata and status
- `skill_agent_results` - Skill matching scores
- `semantic_agent_results` - Semantic matching scores
- `experience_agent_results` - Experience validation scores
- `education_agent_results` - Education matching scores
- `certification_agent_results` - Certification matching scores

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Why does it show "Waiting for first analysis"?**
A: No multi-agent analyses have been run yet. Call the `/api/score-multi-agent/:resume_id/:job_id` endpoint to generate results.

**Q: Why does it show "No recent fork activity"?**
A: No forks have been created in the last 24 hours. Run a multi-agent analysis to create forks.

**Q: Why are some agents showing "Ready (table not yet created)"?**
A: The agent results tables are created on first agent run. This is normal for fresh installations.

**Q: How do I clear old fork data?**
A: The system automatically cleans up forks older than 24 hours. To see older data, modify the query in `displayForkResultsOnStartup()` to use a longer interval.

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Real-time fork monitoring endpoint
- [ ] Fork success/failure rates
- [ ] Agent performance comparisons
- [ ] Trend analysis (performance over time)
- [ ] Export fork results to CSV/JSON
- [ ] Fork execution replay/debugging
