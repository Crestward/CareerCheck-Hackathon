## 🔴 CRITICAL BUGS

### Bug #1: ForkManager Field Name Mismatches (BLOCKING)
**File**: `lib/fork-manager.js` lines 247-307
**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL - Causes NULL inserts into database
**Scope**: All 5 agents affected

**Issue**:
The `storeAgentResults()` method tries to access field names that don't match what agents actually return:

```javascript
// WRONG - These field names don't exist in agent results:
results.skill_score          // Should be: results.score
results.matched_skills       // Should be: results.matchedSkills
results.experience_score     // Should be: results.score
results.candidate_years      // Should be: results.candidateYears
results.required_years       // Should be: results.requiredYears
results.education_score      // Should be: results.score
results.candidate_level      // Should be: results.candidateDegree
results.required_level       // Should be: results.requiredDegree
results.certification_score  // Should be: results.score
results.matched_certs        // Should be: results.matchedCertifications
results.semantic_score       // Should be: results.score
```

**Impact**:
- Database inserts will have NULL values for score columns
- Results appear empty/zero in database
- Agent results are not properly persisted
- Multi-agent analysis appears to fail silently

**Root Cause**:
Field names were inconsistently defined between:
- What agents return (camelCase: `score`, `matchedSkills`, etc.)
- What database inserts expect (snake_case with agent prefixes: `skill_score`, etc.)

**Fix Required**:
Replace all field access in lines 253-295 to match actual agent return values.

### Bug #2: Coordinator Passes Wrong Database URL to Agents (BLOCKING)
**File**: `lib/agents/coordinator.js` line 120
**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL - Agents connect to wrong database

**Issue**:
```javascript
// WRONG:
const agent = new AgentClass({
  resumeId,
  jobId,
  forkManager: this.forkManager,
  forkUrl: this.databaseUrl,      // ❌ WRONG - Using main database URL
  forkId: fork.fork_id
});

// CORRECT:
forkUrl: fork.databaseUrl,         // ✅ Should use fork's database URL
```

**Impact**:
- Each agent connects to the MAIN database, not their isolated fork
- Agents don't have fork isolation (defeats purpose of Phase 1)
- All agents share same database instance (no parallelism benefit)
- Possible data contamination between agents

**Root Cause**:
Coordinator stores `this.databaseUrl` (main database) but should pass `fork.databaseUrl` (fork-specific database URL returned by ForkManager.createFork()).

**Fix Required**:
Change line 120 to: `forkUrl: fork.databaseUrl,`

---

### Bug #3: BaseAgent Doesn't Verify Fork Database Connection
**File**: `lib/agents/base-agent.js` lines 50-98
**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL - Silent failures if fork unavailable

**Issue**:
The `run()` method creates a database pool but doesn't verify it can actually connect:

```javascript
async run() {
  try {
    // Connects to fork database
    this.forkPool = new Pool({ connectionString: this.forkUrl });

    // Immediately tries to use it without testing connection
    const { resume, job } = await this.loadData();
    // ...
  }
}
```

**Impact**:
- If fork database doesn't exist or is unavailable, error is generic
- No timeout for hung database connections
- Poor error messages for debugging
- Agents may hang indefinitely

**Root Cause**:
No health check or connection test after pool creation. Pool connections are lazy (created on-demand).

**Fix Required**:
Add connection test after pool creation:
```javascript
await this.forkPool.query('SELECT 1');
```

---

### Bug #4: Agents Don't Validate Required Fields in Results
**File**: `lib/agents/base-agent.js` lines 150-172
**Severity**: 🟠 HIGH - Invalid data can pass through

**Issue**:
`validateResults()` only checks that result object exists and has required fields, but doesn't validate:
- Score is numeric and in 0-100 range
- Required field values are correct types
- No validation of nested objects (e.g., `matchedSkills` is array)

```javascript
validateResults(results) {
  if (!results || typeof results !== 'object') {
    throw new Error('Results must be an object');
  }

  // Only checks field EXISTS, not that it's VALID
  const requiredFields = this.getRequiredResultFields();
  for (const field of requiredFields) {
    if (!(field in results)) {
      throw new Error(`Missing required field in results: ${field}`);
    }
  }
  // No validation of actual values!
}
```

**Impact**:
- Invalid scores (NaN, negative, >100) can pass validation
- Malformed data structures accepted
- Bad data propagates to database and frontend

**Fix Required**:
Add validation of actual values and types in each agent's override of validateResults().

---

### Bug #5: Server Multi-Agent Endpoint Uses Wrong ForkManager Instance
**File**: `server.js` lines 116-129
**Severity**: 🟠 HIGH - Multi-agent endpoint may fail

**Issue**:
ForkManager is initialized in server startup but may not exist if database connection fails:

```javascript
let forkManager = null;
let agentCoordinator = null;

if (DB_CONNECTION_STRING && usingDatabase) {
  try {
    forkManager = new ForkManager(DB_CONNECTION_STRING);  // ← May not get set
    agentCoordinator = new AgentCoordinator({
      forkManager: forkManager,
      // ...
    });
  } catch (error) {
    // Silently continues if initialization fails
    console.warn('...');
  }
}

// Later in endpoint:
if (!agentCoordinator || !forkManager) {
  return res.status(503).json({ error: 'Multi-agent system not available' });
}
```

**Impact**:
- If database connection fails after startup, system state is inconsistent
- ForkManager may be null but agentCoordinator non-null (or vice versa)
- 503 error response is correct but late (should fail fast at startup)

**Fix Required**:
Separate database connection testing from ForkManager initialization. Fail fast if database not available.

---

## 🟠 LOGICAL INCONSISTENCIES

### Inconsistency #1: Database Retrieval Order in Multi-Agent Endpoint
**File**: `server.js` lines 1294-1312
**Issue Level**: Medium

**Code**:
```javascript
const [resumeResult, jobResult] = await Promise.all([
  pool.query('SELECT * FROM resumes WHERE resume_id = $1', [resume_id]),
  pool.query('SELECT * FROM jobs WHERE job_id = $1', [job_id])
]);
```

**Inconsistency**:
Resume table isn't explicitly created in migrations. The migration 002 creates `resumes` and `jobs` tables, but the code doesn't verify these tables exist before trying to query them.

**Impact**:
- If migration wasn't run, endpoint throws cryptic "relation does not exist" error
- No helpful error message about missing migrations

**Fix Required**:
Either:
1. Assume migrations were run (acceptable if init script guarantees this)
2. Add explicit table existence check
3. Better error handling with helpful message

**Status**: Low priority (acceptable if init script is always run first)

---

### Inconsistency #2: Agent Field Names Are Inconsistent Across Agents
**File**: All agent classes (skill, experience, education, certification, semantic)
**Issue Level**: Medium

**Example**:
- SkillAgent returns `score`
- EducationAgent returns `score`
- SemanticAgent returns `score`

But database expects different names:
- `skill_score` (from SkillAgent)
- `education_score` (from EducationAgent)

**Impact**:
- Code is confusing (which field to access?)
- Easy to make mistakes (like in ForkManager Bug #1)
- Inconsistent API surface

**Fix Required**:
Choose one approach:
1. Keep agents return snake_case matching database (e.g., `skill_score`)
2. Keep agents return camelCase and fix database inserts to match
3. Create a mapping layer

**Recommendation**: Use approach #2 (fixed in Bug #1 fix)

---

### Inconsistency #3: Agent Timeout Handling vs. Actual Timeouts
**File**: `lib/agents/coordinator.js` lines 159-164
**Issue Level**: Low

**Code**:
```javascript
createTimeout(agentType) {
  return new Promise((_, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      reject(new Error(`${agentType} agent timeout (>${this.timeout}ms)`));
    }, this.timeout);  // Default: 120000ms (2 minutes)
  });
}
```

**Inconsistency**:
Timeout is created but agent database pool has its own timeout settings:

```javascript
// In BaseAgent.run():
this.forkPool = new Pool({ connectionString: this.forkUrl });
// Pool defaults to 30s idle timeout, 5s connect timeout
```

**Impact**:
- Database connections may timeout before Promise.race() timeout triggers
- Error messages misleading (says "120 second timeout" but fails at 5-30s)
- Cascading timeout errors confusing

**Fix Required**:
Document that pool timeouts are separate from agent timeouts. Use consistent timeout values or explain difference clearly.

## 🟡 CODE QUALITY ISSUES

### Quality Issue #1: No Input Sanitization in Agent Classes
**File**: All agent classes
**Severity**: Medium

**Issue**:
Agents extract text from resume/job objects but don't validate or sanitize input:

```javascript
const resumeText = this.extractResumeText(resume);
// No checks for:
// - String length (could be huge)
// - Special characters
// - Encoding issues
```

**Impact**:
- Very long resume text could cause performance issues
- Malformed Unicode could break regex operations
- No protection against adversarial input

**Fix Required**:
Add input validation:
- Maximum text length checks (e.g., 1MB max)
- Character encoding validation
- Safe string truncation

---

### Quality Issue #2: Error Messages Are Sometimes Too Generic
**File**: `lib/fork-manager.js`, `lib/agents/base-agent.js`
**Severity**: Low

**Example**:
```javascript
console.error('[ForkManager] Error storing results:', error.message);
// Doesn't say WHICH agent or which type of results
```

**Impact**:
- Hard to debug when running 5 agents in parallel
- Multiple agents failing, can't tell which one
- Logs are hard to parse

**Fix Required**:
Include context in error messages:
```javascript
console.error(`[ForkManager] Error storing ${agentType} results: ${error.message}`);
```

---
