# Resume-Job Fit Analyzer

An enterprise-grade intelligent hiring system that analyzes how well a resume matches a job description using a five-dimensional fit score powered by Tiger Data features (pgvector, full-text search, and database forks for parallel processing).

## Features

- **Resume Upload** - Upload PDF or text resumes
- **Job Description** - Enter job requirements
- **Five-Dimensional Fit Score** - Comprehensive analysis across:
  - **Skill Match** (25-40%) - Technical skill matching with fuzzy matching for variations
  - **Semantic Alignment** (15-25%) - pgvector embeddings for contextual understanding
  - **Experience Validation** (10-35%) - Years of experience comparison
  - **Education Matching** (15-30%) - Education level alignment
  - **Certification Verification** (5-20%) - Professional certification matching
- **Dynamic Weight Adjustment** - Weights automatically adapt based on job type (Senior/Leadership, Data Science/ML, Security/Compliance, etc.)
- **Multi-Agent Processing** - Parallel analysis with database forks for 4-5x speedup
- **Continuous Learning** - Knowledge base discovers and remembers new skills
- **Comprehensive Analysis** - Includes strengths, gaps, and actionable recommendations
- **Production Ready** - PostgreSQL with Tiger Data features for reliability and performance

## Quick Start

## Configuration

Edit `.env` to customize:

```
PORT=8084                                    # Server port (default 8084)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...               # PostgreSQL connection string
EMBEDDING_METHOD=stub                       # stub or openai (default: stub)
WEIGHT_KEYWORD=0.25                         # Keyword/skill weight (default: 0.25, 25%)
WEIGHT_SEMANTIC=0.15                        # Semantic weight (default: 0.15, 15%)
WEIGHT_STRUCTURED=0.10                      # Experience weight (default: 0.10, 10%)
WEIGHT_EDUCATION=0.30                       # Education weight (default: 0.30, 30%)
WEIGHT_CERTIFICATION=0.20                   # Certification weight (default: 0.20, 20%)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...                      # (optional) For OpenAI embeddings

# Multi-Agent System (optional)
MULTI_AGENT_ENABLED=true                    # Enable parallel multi-agent scoring
MAX_CONCURRENT_FORKS=10                     # Max concurrent database forks
FORK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=30                     # Timeout per fork
```

**Note:** Default weights are balanced. Weights are automatically adjusted based on job type (Senior/Leadership, Data Science/ML, Security/Compliance).

## How It Works

### 1. Resume Upload
- Extract text from PDF, DOCX, or text files
- Parse resume to extract: name, skills, experience, education, certifications
- Generate embedding vectors for semantic analysis (pgvector)
- Store in PostgreSQL with JSONB for flexible schema

### 2. Job Description
- Store job title, description, required experience level
- Generate embedding vector for semantic matching
- Detect job type to optimize weight profile

### 3. Five-Dimensional Scoring

#### Dimension 1: Skill Match (25-40%)
- Extract 200+ technical skills using regex-based matcher
- Use fuzzy matching to handle variations (e.g., "nodejs" → "Node.js")
- Calculate percentage match: (Matched Skills / Required Skills) × 100

#### Dimension 2: Semantic Alignment (15-25%)
- Use pgvector embeddings for contextual understanding
- Calculate cosine similarity between resume and job embeddings
- Understand contextual relationships (e.g., "ML Engineer" ≈ "Machine Learning Developer")

#### Dimension 3: Experience Validation (10-35%)
- Compare candidate's years of experience vs. required years
- Formula: min((Candidate Years / Required Years) × 100, 100)
- Weight increases for senior/leadership roles

#### Dimension 4: Education Matching (15-30%)
- Evaluate education level alignment (High School → Bachelor → Master → PhD)
- Exact match = 100%, within 1 level = 80%, further = 60%
- Weight increases for academic-focused roles

#### Dimension 5: Certification Verification (5-20%)
- Extract and match professional certifications
- Calculate percentage match: (Matched Certs / Required Certs) × 100
- Weight increases for regulated industries (security, compliance)

### 4. Dynamic Weight Adjustment
Weights automatically adapt based on job characteristics:
- **Senior/Leadership Roles:** Experience-heavy (35%)
- **Data Science/ML Roles:** Skills & Semantic-heavy (40% + 25%)
- **Security/Compliance:** Certification-heavy (15%)
- **Default (Balanced):** Education-heavy (30%)

### 5. Multi-Agent Processing (Optional)
If database is available:
- Create 5 specialized agents (Skill, Semantic, Experience, Education, Certification)
- Run agents in parallel using database forks (zero-copy, sub-100ms creation)
- Each agent analyzes on isolated fork
- Merge results for composite score
- **Result: 4-5x faster than sequential**

### 6. Result
- Display comprehensive fit analysis
- Show overall rating (Excellent/Good/Moderate/Below Average)
- List strengths and areas for development
- Provide hiring recommendation
- Store results in database for analytics

## Tiger Data Features Used

This project leverages PostgreSQL Tiger Data features for enterprise-grade hiring intelligence:

### pgvector (Semantic Search)
- Vector embeddings for semantic similarity matching
- IVFFlat indexing for fast O(1) similarity search
- Enables contextual understanding beyond keywords
- Used by: Semantic Agent for job-resume alignment

### Full-Text Search (pg_tsvector)
- Linguistic-aware skill matching
- Stemming and pluralization handling
- Finds variations of skills (e.g., "python", "Python", "PYTHON")
- Used by: Skill Agent for technical skill extraction

### JSONB (Flexible Storage)
- Store structured and unstructured resume data together
- Fast JSON queries on resume fields
- Schema flexibility without migrations
- Used by: Resume and Job storage with metadata

### Database Forks (Fast Forks)
- Zero-copy database forks for agent isolation
- Sub-100ms fork creation
- Enables true parallel processing
- 5 agents × parallel execution = 4-5x speedup
- Used by: Multi-Agent Coordinator for parallel scoring

### Knowledge Base with Continuous Learning
- SQL functions and views for skill discovery
- Tracks skill frequency and confidence
- System learns from every resume analyzed
- Used by: Continuous learning to improve over time

## Embedding Methods

### Stub (Default)
- Uses hash-based deterministic embeddings
- No API key required
- Fast for development/testing
- Good for MVP validation

### OpenAI (Optional)
- Uses OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model
- Superior semantic understanding
- Requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
- Recommended for production deployments

## Storage

### With PostgreSQL (Recommended for Production)
- ✅ Persistent data storage
- ✅ Multi-user support
- ✅ Advanced Tiger Data features (pgvector, tsvector, forks)
- ✅ Analytics and reporting
- ✅ Automatic backups
- Set `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to enable

### In-Memory Fallback (Development/Testing)
- ✅ Zero setup required
- ✅ No password management
- ✅ Fast performance
- ⚠️ Data lost on server restart
- Used automatically if `DATABASE_URL` not set

## Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start
```bash
# Check if port 8084 is already in use
# Change port in .env: PORT=8085

# Clear npm cache and reinstall
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm start
```

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Verify DATABASE_URL is set correctly
echo $DATABASE_URL

# Test connection manually
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT version();"

# Run migrations if tables don't exist
node scripts/run-migrations.js
```

### Multi-Agent System Not Starting
```bash
# Check database connection first
npm start

# If multi-agent fails but single-agent works, check logs:
# Multi-agent requires DATABASE_URL to be set

# Try basic initialization
node scripts/init-agentic-postgres.js
```

### No Emojis in Logs
This is expected behavior. All logging now uses clean text for professional output.

### Resume Not Uploading
- Check file size (should be <10MB)
- Verify file format (PDF, DOCX, or TXT)
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure `/api/upload-resume` endpoint is accessible

## Key Endpoints Cheat Sheet

```bash
# Upload resume
curl -F "file=@resume.pdf" http://localhost:8084/api/upload-resume

# Create job
curl -X POST http://localhost:8084/api/job-description \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Python Developer","description":"...","required_years":3}'
