# üìä Five-Dimensional Fit Score Formula

## Overview

The Resume-Job Fit Analyzer uses a **five-dimensional weighted scoring system** to calculate a comprehensive overall fit score. Each dimension evaluates a different aspect of candidate-job alignment.

---

## The Five Dimensions

### 1. **Skill Match** (Keyword Score)
- **What it measures:** Technical skills extraction and matching
- **How it works:** Extracts skills from resume and job description, then calculates percentage match
- **Score range:** 0-100
- **Default weight:** 25-40% (varies by job type)
- **Formula:** `(Matched Skills / Required Skills) √ó 100`

### 2. **Semantic Match** (Vector Similarity)
- **What it measures:** Contextual and semantic relevance
- **How it works:** Uses embeddings to find conceptual matches beyond keyword matching
- **Score range:** 0-100
- **Default weight:** 15-25% (varies by job type)
- **Technology:** pgvector with embedding similarity

### 3. **Experience Match** (Structured Score)
- **What it measures:** Years of experience vs. job requirements
- **How it works:** Compares candidate's total experience with required years
- **Score range:** 0-100
- **Default weight:** 10-35% (varies by job type)
- **Formula:** `min((Candidate Years / Required Years) √ó 100, 100)`

### 4. **Education Match**
- **What it measures:** Education level alignment
- **How it works:** Compares education levels (High School, Bachelor, Master, PhD, etc.)
- **Score range:** 0-100
- **Default weight:** 15-30% (varies by job type)
- **Scoring:** Exact match = 100%, within 1 level = 80%, further = 60%

### 5. **Certification Match**
- **What it measures:** Relevant certifications
- **How it works:** Extracts certifications from resume and job description, calculates match
- **Score range:** 0-100
- **Default weight:** 5-20% (varies by job type)
- **Formula:** `(Matched Certifications / Required Certifications) √ó 100`

## Overall Fit Score Calculation

### Standard Formula

```
Overall Fit Score =
  (Skill Match √ó w‚ÇÅ) +
  (Semantic Match √ó w‚ÇÇ) +
  (Experience Match √ó w‚ÇÉ) +
  (Education Match √ó w‚ÇÑ) +
  (Certification Match √ó w‚ÇÖ)

Where:
  w‚ÇÅ + w‚ÇÇ + w‚ÇÉ + w‚ÇÑ + w‚ÇÖ = 1.0 (100%)
  All weights are dynamic and sum to exactly 1.0
```

### In Plain Terms

The overall fit score is a **weighted average** of the five dimension scores, where:
- Each dimension contributes its score multiplied by its weight
- Weights are adjusted dynamically based on the job type
- The result is a single 0-100 score representing overall fit

---

## Dynamic Weight Profiles

Weights are automatically adjusted based on job characteristics detected from the job title and description:

### Profile 1: Senior/Leadership Roles
Detected by: "senior", "lead", "principal", "manager", "director"
```
Skill Match:     30%
Semantic:        15%
Experience:      35%  ‚Üê Emphasized
Education:       15%
Certification:    5%
```

### Profile 2: Data Science/ML Roles
Detected by: "data", "machine learning", "tensorflow", "model"
```
Skill Match:     40%  ‚Üê Emphasized
Semantic:        25%  ‚Üê Emphasized
Experience:      15%
Education:       15%
Certification:    5%
```

### Profile 3: Security/Compliance Roles
Detected by: "security", "compliance", "audit", "certification"
```
Skill Match:     30%
Semantic:        20%
Experience:      20%
Education:       15%
Certification:   15%  ‚Üê Emphasized
```

### Profile 4: Default/Balanced Profile
Used when no specific role is detected:
```
Skill Match:     25%
Semantic:        15%
Experience:      10%
Education:       30%  ‚Üê Emphasized
Certification:   20%
```

## Calculation Example

### Example Scenario
**Job:** "Senior Python Developer"
**Dimensions Scores:**
- Skill Match: 85
- Semantic: 78
- Experience: 92
- Education: 75
- Certification: 60

**Detected Profile:** Senior/Leadership (Experience-heavy)
**Weights Applied:**
- Skill: 30%
- Semantic: 15%
- Experience: 35%
- Education: 15%
- Certification: 5%

### Calculation
```
Overall Fit Score = (85 √ó 0.30) + (78 √ó 0.15) + (92 √ó 0.35) + (75 √ó 0.15) + (60 √ó 0.05)
                  = 25.5 + 11.7 + 32.2 + 11.25 + 3.0
                  = 83.65
                  ‚âà 83.65% ‚Üê FINAL FIT SCORE
```

## Implementation Details

### Database Storage
- Composite scores stored in `multi_agent_scores` table
- Individual dimension scores tracked separately
- Weight adjustments recorded for analytics

### Real-time Calculation
- Weights calculated on-demand per job
- No cached weight profiles
- Ensures accuracy for unique job descriptions

### Fallback Mechanism
- If database fails, uses built-in weight profiles
- Always returns valid composite score
- Graceful degradation maintains functionality

## Advantages of This Approach

1. **Holistic Evaluation:** Considers multiple dimensions of fit
2. **Job-Aware Weighting:** Emphasizes dimensions relevant to specific roles
3. **Transparent:** Users see all component scores
4. **Adaptable:** Weights adjust based on job characteristics
5. **Fair:** Normalized scales ensure fair comparison across dimensions
6. **Professional:** Grading scale aligns with industry standards

## Formula Verification

To verify the calculation is correct:
1. Sum all five dimension scores multiplied by their weights
2. Weights should sum to exactly 1.0
3. Result should be between 0 and 100
4. Round to 2 decimal places for display

Example verification:
```
0.30 + 0.15 + 0.35 + 0.15 + 0.05 = 1.00 ‚úì
(85 √ó 0.30) + (78 √ó 0.15) + (92 √ó 0.35) + (75 √ó 0.15) + (60 √ó 0.05) = 83.65 ‚úì
0 ‚â§ 83.65 ‚â§ 100 ‚úì
```
