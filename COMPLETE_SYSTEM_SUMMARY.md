## 🚀 HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS

### Single Resume-Job Analysis:

```
User Request
    ↓
/api/score-multi-agent/:resume_id/:job_id
    ↓
Agent Coordinator
    ├─ Creates 5 database forks (zero-copy, instant)
    ├─ Spins up 5 agents in parallel
    │   ├─ SkillAgent (analyzes technical skills)
    │   ├─ ExperienceAgent (validates years)
    │   ├─ EducationAgent (matches degrees)
    │   ├─ CertificationAgent (checks credentials)
    │   └─ SemanticAgent (embedding similarity)
    ├─ All agents run SIMULTANEOUSLY
    ├─ Collects results (timeout: 2 minutes)
    └─ Aggregates with weighted scoring
    ↓
Returns:
{
  "composite_score": 78.5,
  "scores": {
    "skill": 82,
    "experience": 75,
    "education": 80,
    "certification": 70,
    "semantic": 77
  },
  "breakdown": { /* detailed results */ },
  "processing_time_ms": 8200,
  "agents_completed": 5
}
```

### Performance:
- **Total Time**: ~8 seconds (all agents run in parallel)
- **Without Parallelism**: ~40 seconds (sequential would be 8s × 5)
- **Speedup**: **5x faster** thanks to Fast Forks

## 📞 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If agents fail with "fork not found":
- Check that Phase 1 initialization ran successfully
- Verify PostgreSQL has tiger extensions installed
- Check database connection string in .env

### If scores show as NULL in database:
- **This is now fixed** (Bug #1 fix)
- If still happening, check server logs for errors

### If agents connect to wrong database:
- **This is now fixed** (Bug #2 fix)
- Verify coordinator.js has fork.databaseUrl (line 120)

### If connection errors appear:
- **This is now fixed** (Bug #3 fix)
- System will now show clear error message instead of hanging

### General debugging:
- Check server logs (timestamp + [Component Name] + message)
- Verify database tables exist: `psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\dt agent_*"`
- Test health endpoint: `curl http://localhost:8080/api/health`

---

## 💡 TIPS & BEST PRACTICES

### For Optimal Performance:
- Keep database connection pool size reasonable (default: 20)
- Monitor fork cleanup (runs every 30 min automatically)
- Check agent execution times in logs
- Archive old results monthly

### For Reliability:
- Always run Phase 1 initialization before production
- Keep backups of database
- Monitor error rates daily
- Review logs weekly for patterns

### For Scalability:
- Batch processing (Phase 3) for 1000s of candidates
- Implement caching for common jobs
- Consider read replicas for analytics queries
- Plan for agent scaling (more agent types)

---

## 🎓 KEY CONCEPTS

### Fast Forks
- Zero-copy database snapshots
- Each agent gets isolated fork
- Enables true parallelism
- Forks auto-cleaned after 24 hours

### Agent System
- 5 specialized agents, each expert in domain
- All run in parallel via Fast Forks
- Results aggregated with weighted scoring
- Fault-tolerant (one agent failure doesn't break system)

### Weighted Scoring
- Each agent produces 0-100 score
- Weights: skill (25%), semantic (20%), experience (20%), education (20%), certification (15%)
- Composite = weighted average
- Phase 3 adds dynamic weight adjustment by job type

### Database Integration
- Results stored in proper schema (9 tables)
- Fork tracking for audit trail
- Performance metrics recorded
- Historical data available for analysis
